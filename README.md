# Project Description

This is a simple study program on how to use public APIs and API keys, html and css. 

## Installation

Clone the project to your computer using
git clone https://github.com/talvio/My-Zootopia.git

Ensure you have requests library installed. 

## Usage

Run with "python3 animals_web_generator.py".  
The results of your interactions will be animals.html file. Open it with any browser. 

The code is simple so you can learn from it, and find the mistakes if you like, and expand on it. 
One thing I would do is to make this a web application. Would not take much. 

Install pytest (pip3 install pytest). There is only one unit test which you can run with "pytest".
Adding more unit tests is a good exercise. 

## Contributing Guidelines

If you decide to use this start as a basis for more tinkering and learning, you could share as separate 
branches to this repository additional lessons. E.g. writing instructions how to get to this point
and how expand and lear more could be useful for people beginning in python.
